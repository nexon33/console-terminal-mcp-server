# Model Context Protocol Server

This project implements a minimal server based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using TypeScript. The server is designed to handle requests according to the MCP specifications.

## Project Structure

```
mcp-server
├── src
│   ├── server.ts        # Entry point of the MCP server
│   └── types
│       └── index.ts     # Type definitions for MCP
├── package.json         # NPM package configuration
├── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mcp-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project:**
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run the server:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, it will listen for incoming requests that conform to the Model Context Protocol. You can send requests to the server using tools like Postman or curl.

## Model Context Protocol

The Model Context Protocol defines a standard for communication between clients and servers, focusing on the structure of the data exchanged. This implementation adheres to the specifications outlined in the MCP documentation.
